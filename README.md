# HR Analytics: Predicting employee turnover with machine learning

Using a dataset of employee attributes related to salary, job class, satisfaction and annual review evaluation, I build two machine learning models (DecisionTreeClassifier and LogsiticRegression) that can best predict employee turnover based on these and other features.

I then compare the results of each model, discuss their pros and cons and evalute which would be best to apply for different business needs.
